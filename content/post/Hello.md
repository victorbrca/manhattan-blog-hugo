Hello, my name is Victor. I'm a technical consultant with over ten years of experience in Manhattan WMOS implementations. I'm specialized in the design and systems integration, taking care of the application and system aspects of the project.

I have worked for a few big-name companies in Canada (Shoppers Drug Mart, Home Hardware and LCBO), implementing multiple versions of WMOS, including other components like Vocollect, DOM, EEM and SCI.

I will share some of the knowledge I gained over the years, and I hope to help as much as possible.

You can view my work experience and download a copy of my Resume from my company website - https://geekit.ca.
